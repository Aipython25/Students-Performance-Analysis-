# Stock Price Prediction 📈

This project uses Python to predict stock prices using machine learning.  
It fetches real stock data using the `yfinance` library, processes it with `pandas` and `numpy`, applies `Linear Regression` using `scikit-learn`, and visualizes the predictions using `matplotlib`.
